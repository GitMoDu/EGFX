# EGFX - Embedded Graphics Framework

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/GitMoDu/EGFX)](LICENSE)

EGFX is a frame-buffer-based graphics framework designed for embedded systems with limited resources, targeting Arduino-compatible microcontrollers.
It provides a complete graphics pipeline with hardware-accelerated display drivers, efficient rendering primitives, and a task-based architecture that avoids CPU hogging.

## Overview

![Library Organization](https://github.com/GitMoDu/EGFX/blob/master/media/high_level_organization.png)

The library is organized into five main components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[Framebuffer](src/Framebuffer/)** | Manages screen memory and rendering operations |
| **[ScreenDrivers](src/ScreenDrivers/)** | Handles display communication over SPI/I2C with optional DMA, Async, and RTOS support |
| **[DisplayEngine](src/DisplayEngine/)** | Orchestrates the complete graphics pipeline—managing the asynchronous draw cycle, frame timing, buffer flipping, and pushing frames to the display |
| **[Framework](src/Framework/)** | Template-driven compile-time toolkit for building UIs: Drawables, Views, Layouts, Shaders, Fonts, and Text |
| **[Modules](src/Modules/)** | Self-contained, reusable views built on top of the Framework |

## 🧩 Framework

The Framework (`src/Framework/`) is EGFX's compile-time toolkit for building UI elements. It is built on two core contracts—**Drawables** and **Views**—and extends outward through Layouts, Shaders, graphics subsystems, and text rendering.

### Drawables

Drawables are **passive renderers**: they draw their current state to a framebuffer in a single `Draw()` call, without any animation logic.

```cpp
// Drawable contract
struct Drawable {
    void Draw(IFrameBuffer* frame) {}
};
```

All graphics subsystems (bitmask, bitmap, vector, code) produce Drawables.

### Views

Views **orchestrate animation and composition** over time. A View may require multiple `DrawCall()` invocations to complete a single frame cycle, enabling cooperative rendering without blocking the CPU.

```cpp
// View contract
struct View {
    bool DrawCall(IFrameBuffer* frame, const uint32_t frameTime, const uint16_t frameCounter) {
        return true; // true = cycle complete
    }
};
```

The Framework provides several View types:

| View Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **`ViewAdapter`** | Adapts a view to the engine's `IFrameDraw` interface; the view controls skip/completion through its draw-call result |
| **`AbstractView`** | Base view with overridable `ViewStep()` for animation and sequential drawable dispatch |
| **`DrawablesView`** | Manages a compile-time pack of Drawables, rendering them sequentially across draw calls |
| **`CompositeView`** | Composes multiple child Views, advancing them sequentially within a single frame cycle |

### Layouts

The layout system computes positions and sizes **entirely at compile time**—zero runtime overhead.

| Layout | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **`Grid`** | Divides a region into equal rows and columns |
| **`Weighted`** | Splits a region by proportional weights |
| **`Margin`** | Applies inner margins to a region |
| **`Align`** | Aligns an element within a region |
| **`ConstrainedDimensions`** | Constrains an element to min/max dimensions |
| **`ConstrainedRatio`** | Constrains an element to an aspect ratio |

### Shaders

The shader pipeline provides composable, template-driven effects:

| Shader Category | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Color Sources** | Checkerboard, Gradient, AxisSplit |
| **Color Shaders** | Invert, Brightness, Contrast, Saturation |
| **Transform Shaders** | Translate, Crop, Orient, ScaleDown, Skew, Rotate, DitherMask |
| **Pixel Shaders** | Per-pixel effects applied during rendering |
| **Primitive Shaders** | Effects applied to shape primitives |

Vector images, icons, and vector text use a shared pipeline: packed nodes are read by the vector decoder, scaled into signed local coordinates, and dispatched to the vector image shader for primitive rasterization. Geometry is clipped to the drawable bounds before coordinates enter the unsigned pixel and framebuffer APIs, preventing partially off-screen shapes from wrapping across the display.

### Graphics Subsystems

Each subsystem provides its own Model, Drawer, and Drawable templates:

| Subsystem | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Bitmask** | 1-bit sprites with template drawer and drawable; supports both Flash (ROM) and RAM sources |
| **Bitmap** | Multi-color-mode bitmaps with template drawer and drawable; supports both Flash (ROM) and RAM sources |
| **Vector** | Encoded vector shapes decoded into shared image, icon, and text drawables; supports compact packed assets and bounded primitive rasterization |
| **Code** | Hard-coded vector drawing with cached intermediates |

### Fonts & Text

Fonts are built on top of graphics subsystems. The text system is a **generic writer templated on any font drawer**.

| Font Type | Family | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Vector Font** | Epoxy (Full, Numbers) | Dynamically scalable, compact encoded vector format, configurable width/height/kerning |
| **Vector Icons** | Silkscreen | Compact encoded icon set rendered through the shared vector image shader |
| **Code Font** | RawBot | Hard-coded vector drawing with cached intermediates, configurable dimensions |
| **Bitmask Font** | Contact (3×5, 5×5), Cyanoacrylate (1×5, 2×5) | Fixed-size pixel-perfect fonts with optional integer scaling, low memory footprint |

### Modules

Modules are **self-contained views** that bundle their own drawables, layouts, and assets. They are built entirely on the Framework and are ready to drop into any display engine setup.

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **FpsDisplay** | Real-time FPS overlay |
| **EgfxLogo** | Animated EGFX logo splash |
| **TerminalWindow** | Scrollable text terminal view |

### Engine State Flow

```
┌──────────┐      ┌───────────┐      ┌─────────┐      ┌──────────┐
│  Clear   │ ───> │  Render   │ ───> │  Sync   │ ───> │   Push   │
│  Buffer  │      │Draw Calls │      │         │      │to Screen │
└──────────┘      └───────────┘      └─────────┘      └──────────┘
     │                                                        │
     └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Concepts

**Draw Calls**: Each visual element is rendered in a separate scheduler pass to avoid blocking the CPU. The engine automatically manages draw call sequencing.

**Frame Synchronization**: The engine maintains target FPS with automatic frame skip detection and compensation.

**Memory Efficiency**: Frame buffers can be statically allocated or dynamically managed based on your platform's capabilities.

> **Note**: Frame-buffer rendering requires sufficient RAM to hold a complete frame. Ensure your MCU has adequate memory for your chosen resolution and color depth.

### Display Drivers

EGFX includes optimized drivers with optional DMA, Async, and RTOS variants:

| Display | Color Depth | Interface |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **SSD1306** | Monochrome | I2C, SPI |
| **SH1106** | Monochrome | SPI |
| **SSD1331** | 8-bit, 16-bit | SPI |
| **SSD1351** | 16-bit | SPI |
| **ST7735** | 16-bit | SPI |
| **ST7789** | 16-bit | SPI |

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

Enable real-time performance metrics with `PerformanceLogTask`:

```cpp
// Enable performance monitoring
#define EGFX_PERFORMANCE_LOG
#define EGFX_PERFORMANCE_LOG_DETAIL

Egfx::PerformanceLogTask<2000> engineLog(scheduler, displayEngine);
engineLog.Start();
```

Tracks:
- Display FPS
- Draw call count and longest duration
- Frame-buffer clear duration
- Render duration and CPU load
- Push duration and occupancy
- Idle duration (power saving)

## 📂 Examples

### [EngineDemo](examples/EngineDemo/)

The recommended starting point. Each demo is automatically cycled and demonstrates best practices for implementing views:

1. **LogoSplashDemo** — Animated EGFX logo using the EgfxLogo module
2. **PrimitiveDemo** — Animated lines, rectangles, and triangles
3. **VectorTextDemo** — Dynamic text with vector fonts and animated scaling
4. **BitmaskTextDemo** — Fast text rendering with multiple scales
5. **ImageDemo** — Full-color bitmap rendering with rotation and brightness. For Monochrome displays, the demo uses bitmask with rotation instead.

#### Quick Start
1. Open `DisplayConfiguration.h` and select your screen type
2. Configure pin definitions for your platform
3. Upload to your board
4. Watch as demos automatically cycle

### [TerminalDisplay](examples/TerminalDisplay/)

A practical example using the **TerminalWindow** module to create a scrollable text display, demonstrating module-based UI composition.
